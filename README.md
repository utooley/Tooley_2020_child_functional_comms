## Tooley et al., 2020

This repo contains code accompanying xxx, as well as . We provide two freely available partitions, or assignments of regions to communities (sometimes called networks), that were derived from children ages 9-11.

For more details see preprint xxx.


## Code

Preprocessing was conducted using x (link). Code used in this repo depends heavily on that of the xxx (Yeo group), which must be set up and enabled to run functions in the `code/yeo_networks` folder. Also depends on Aicher WSBM model (cite), code found in MATLAB here.

## Partitions

(Image here of brains)

Both the developmental clustering partition and the developmental WSBM are provided in xxx and xxx space in `brains`. The WSBM is also provided as a vector of assignments for the Schaefer xx parcellation, available here.
