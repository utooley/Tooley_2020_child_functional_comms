## WSBM example

This folder contains example code to run the WSBM on two subjects. The resulting example WSBM partition, because of the low number of subjects, may differ across runs of the code. 

## Requirements
The weighted stochastic block model (WSBM, `code/wsbm`) was run using v1.2 code from Aicher et al. (2015), found [here](https://aaronclauset.github.io/wsbm/), which must be installed for MATLAB. The Network Community Toolbox ([here](http://commdetect.weebly.com/) and GenLouvain 2.1 [code](http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain) must also be in your MATLAB path to use the iterative WSBM consensus algorithm.
